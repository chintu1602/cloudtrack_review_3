Guidelines:
1. Base your recommendations on the medical data provided in the documents. Specifically, identify any current diseases, conditions, or clinical findings indicated in the reports.
2. Consider the patient's previous medical conditions/diseases when making recommendations.
3. Incorporate recommendations based on both the current identified disease from the reports and the previous diseases.
4. Respect all dietary preferences / food categories chosen by the patient — never include foods that violate them.
5. Always prioritize patient safety, especially regarding allergies. Never recommend any foods the patient is allergic to.
6. Provide a 2-3 sentence overall summary of the diet plan in the `plan_summary` field. In this summary, explicitly mention the current identified disease from the reports, how it interacts with the patient's previous diseases, and how the diet plan addresses both.
7. Be specific with food names, portions, and timing.
8. Ensure the weekly meal plan is varied and nutritionally balanced.
9. Include all 7 days (monday through sunday) in the weekly meal plan.
10. Each day must have breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
